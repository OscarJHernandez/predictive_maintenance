Analysis of the predictive maintenance problem.

Author: Oscar Javier Hernandez

# Setup 

To run the program, the easiest way is to use conda to install all dependencies. Please visit
their website at: [at this link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) in order to install
it for your operating system.


To create the enviroment with all dependencies required to run the jupyter notebook:
```
conda env create -f pm_2019.yml
```

To activate the environment 
```
source activate cdl_2019
```

# Task
Given the N-inputs from the sensor data, predict the 


# Dataset 
The dataset is provided from the Nasa data set []()

# Approach
1. Data visualization
2. Calculation of relevant metrics
3. Mutual information matrix (MIM)
4. Clustering using correlation values of the MIM
* Use Self organizing maps for feature selection
4.a Visualization of clustering features
4.b Selection of clusters
5. PCA on the selected clusters
6. Visualization of time dependance of PCA vector
7. EDM decomposition for monotonic signals  
8.
